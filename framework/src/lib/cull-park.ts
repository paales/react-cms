/**
 * Client state for cull-to-park — the module that decides what a
 * cullable parton's two Activity slots (see `cull-slot.tsx`) show.
 *
 * A cullable keepalive parton renders as a stable two-slot pair: a
 * CONTENT slot (cache variant `mk`) and a SKELETON slot (cache
 * variant `mk~cull` — see `cull-key.ts`). A culling flip is an
 * Activity MODE change on those slots, never a child replacement, so
 * the out-of-view content subtree PARKS (fiber alive, DOM kept,
 * effects unmounted) instead of being destroyed — and a return visit
 * restores it in place, client state intact.
 *
 * This module owns:
 *
 *   - the REPORTED viewport state per parton id — written by the
 *     visibility controller (`visibility.tsx`), read by `CullSlot`
 *     via a subscription. The report IS the display state: slots
 *     flip the moment the observer reports, while the controller's
 *     reload revalidates in the background (fp-skip semantics: a
 *     placeholder confirms the parked copy; fresh bytes replace it).
 *   - the parked-by-culling LRU — culled ids, most-recently-culled
 *     kept. Past `CULL_PARK_CAP`, the oldest id's parked content
 *     slots are destroyed (a return visit is then a cold render —
 *     the pre-parking behavior).
 *   - the per-slot content GENERATION — bumped when fresh content
 *     bytes land for a slot whose mounted fiber has been parked
 *     since its bytes were minted (`parkedSince`). The generation
 *     keys the content slot's Activity, so an fp-moved return
 *     REMOUNTS (drops the parked copy) while an fp-matched restore
 *     and every ordinary live update reconcile in place.
 *   - the observer refcount per id — a flip hands observation from
 *     one slot's `VisibilityObserver` to the other's (Activity
 *     hiding unmounts the parked slot's effects), so "the parton
 *     left the page" is COUNT REACHES ZERO AND STAYS THERE past the
 *     commit's cleanup→mount effect flush, not any single cleanup.
